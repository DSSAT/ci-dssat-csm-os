Checklist for preparing a new release exe:

- CMakeLists.txt - change the version number. This is the one that actually brands the output files.
- Utilities\CSMVersion.for.in - change the version number. 
- Resources\version48.rc - change the version number. This is what brands the exe.
- Manually add the resource file to the project.
- Compile and test everything in the “develop” branch with the release-mode compiler settings
- Tag with a version number
- After testing, pull everything into the “release” branch in git
- Build the exe from the “release” branch with the release-mode compiler settings.
  - check that the exe has the correct version branding
  - check that output files have the correct version branding
- Pull everything into the DSSAT “release” branch on Github for archive.
